  - when deciding whether a change belongs here, in tiangong-lca-skills, in tiangong-lca-mcp, or in a remote runtime repo
whenToUpdate:
  - when command ownership or repo boundaries change
  - when validation, packaging, or coverage rules change
  - when docpact routing, retained source docs, or repo-local governance rules change

## Repo Contract

`tiangong-lca-cli` owns the checked-in public `tiangong` CLI contract: command nouns and verbs, launcher behavior, local artifact workflow, remote session/auth handling, and the repo-level release gate. Start here when the task may change what the CLI does or how it is validated.

## Bootstrap Order

Load docs in this order:

1. `AGENTS.md`
2. `.docpact/config.yaml`
3. `docpact route --root . --intent <intent>` when you need path-specific routing
4. `docs/agents/repo-validation.md` when proof, coverage, CI, or release gating matters
5. `docs/agents/repo-architecture.md` when command ownership, session/runtime layers, or artifact families are unclear
6. `README.md` only for user-facing invocation examples
7. `DEV_CN.md`, `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE_CN.md`, `docs/release-runbook.md`, or `docs/release-setup.md` only when that retained source doc matches the task

Do not start with scattered subcommands or tests before you know which command family owns the task.

Preferred docpact commands:

- `docpact route --root . --intent command-surface`
- `docpact route --root . --intent remote-session`
- `docpact route --root . --intent workflow-commands`
- `docpact route --root . --intent validation-release`
- `docpact route --root . --intent repo-docs`

## Repo Ownership

This repo owns:

- `bin/tiangong.js` as the stable launcher entrypoint
- `src/cli.ts` and `src/main.ts` for command dispatch, process entry, help, and exit behavior
- `src/lib/**` for reusable CLI command logic, session handling, artifacts, and remote adapters
- `test/**` and `scripts/assert-full-coverage.ts` for the hard validation gate
- package metadata, build output contract, and tag/release checks in `package.json` and `scripts/ci/**`

This repo does not own:

- skill packaging and skill wrapper metadata
- MCP transport or inspector surfaces
- remote product or Edge Function business logic
- workspace integration state after merge

Route those tasks to:

- `tiangong-lca-skills` for skill wrappers and `SKILL.md` packages
- `tiangong-lca-mcp` for MCP transports and tool registration
- the owning runtime repo for API, schema, or product behavior
- `lca-workspace` for root integration after merge

## Runtime Facts

- Repo-local documentation governance is encoded in `.docpact/config.yaml` and enforced by `.github/workflows/ai-doc-lint.yml` through `docpact`.
- Package manager: `npm`
- Node baseline: `>=24 <25`
- Runtime style: TypeScript source, Node-native CLI, direct REST and Edge Function access only
- Newly added process-maintenance commands such as `process scope-statistics`, `process dedup-review`, `process refresh-references`, and `process verify-rows` still belong to the native CLI command surface in `src/cli.ts` and `src/lib/process-*.ts`.
- `process save-draft` now has a local `ProcessSchema` validation gate before any commit path writes remote state.
- The canonical minimum validation command is `npm run lint`
- The authoritative full gate is `npm run prepush:gate`
- Release tagging is guarded in `.github/workflows/tag-release-from-merge.yml` so only the upstream repository can execute the merge-tag flow.
- Coverage for `src/**/*.ts` is expected to stay at `100%` statements, branches, functions, and lines

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not add orchestration frameworks or new npm dependencies without explicit approval
- Do not move business logic into skill wrappers when the native `tiangong` CLI should own it
- Do not weaken the coverage gate with ignore pragmas; cover the branch or remove dead code
- Do not treat governed docs as optional when command-surface, validation, or release-gate behavior changes; `docpact` should either require a matching source-doc update or record explicit review evidence.
- Do not treat a merged repo PR here as workspace-delivery complete if the root repo still needs a submodule bump

## Workspace Integration

A merged PR in `tiangong-lca-cli` is repo-complete, not delivery-complete.

If the change must ship through the workspace:

1. merge the child PR into `tiangong-lca-cli`
2. update the `lca-workspace` submodule pointer deliberately
3. complete any later workspace-level validation that depends on the updated CLI snapshot
